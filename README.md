HelpersJS
=========

Pre-built functions, objects and other types of code snippet for production development (backed up by unit tests).

---

It's important that every code snippet entering this repo has a serious suite of unit tests attached.

On the long run an interface will be available where developers can download bundles of function/objects.
A little side note: each bundle will be a singleton in order to avoid littering the global scope, name collision and other of those gobal nice stuff.
